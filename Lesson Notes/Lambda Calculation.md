## Notes: Lambda
### Evaluate Different Expressions
How Should different expressions be evaluated? For example in these different expressions does the result change?

$ (3 + 5) ∗ (6 − 3), (3 + 5) ∗ (6 − 3), (3 + 5) ∗ (6 − 3) $

To represent a module with 0 the ⊥ operator is used which is called *bottom, undefined or ... exception*

$ 5 mod 0 ≡⊥ $

A function that is defined to be ⊥ if any of its arguments is ⊥, is called a strict function.
